## 🧠 Mentor Recommendation System for CLAT Aspirants

This system matches CLAT aspirants with suitable mentors based on personalized preferences and preparation profiles. It uses a **Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** approach to provide the most relevant mentor recommendations.

---

### 🔍 Approach Overview

We use a **Weighted KNN (k-nearest neighbors)** algorithm customized to handle categorical and ordinal features.

#### 🧩 Features considered:
- **Preferred Subjects** (e.g., CR, LR, GK)
- **Target College** (e.g., NLSIU, NLU Delhi)
- **Learning Style** (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic)
- **Preparation Level** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)

#### 🎯 Workflow:
1. **Input Encoding:** Convert categorical values into a binary vector representation.
2. **Feature Weighting:** Assign different importance to each feature (e.g., subject match > college match).
3. **Vector Comparison:** Compute similarity between the aspirant and all mentor profiles using weighted vectors.
4. **Top-K Selection:** Recommend top-k (usually 3) mentors with the highest similarity scores.

### 🔄 Learning with Feedback (System Improvement)

Over time, the system can become smarter using **aspirant feedback**:

#### ✅ Feedback Loop Ideas:
- **Explicit Ratings:** After a session, ask the aspirant: “Was this mentor helpful?”
- **Selection Tracking:** Track which mentor the aspirant ends up choosing.
- **Session Outcomes:** Collect data on improvements in test scores or satisfaction.

#### 📈 Future Enhancements:
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommend mentors based on choices made by similar aspirants.
- **Active Learning:** Reweight feature importance dynamically based on feedback trends.
- **LLM-Powered Matching:** Use LLMs to match based on profile narratives rather than structured data.
